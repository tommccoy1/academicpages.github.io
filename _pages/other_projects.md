**Yale Grammatical Diversity Project:** A project that explores the syntactic diversity of North American varieties of English. I have contributed webpages about two syntactic phenomena to this project:

* [*All the further*](https://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/all-the-further). Example: *Our car broke down, and Croton was all the further we got.*
* [Subject contact relatives](https://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/subject-contact-relatives). Example: *There was a farmer had a dog.*

**CogSci Demos**: A webpage of demos, developed with Suhas Arehalli, Hongru Zhu, and Tal Linzen, for teaching concepts important to computational cognitive science: [https://cogscidemos.github.io/](https://cogscidemos.github.io/)
