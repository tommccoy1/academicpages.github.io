I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University, co-advised by [Tal Linzen](http://tallinzen.net/) and [Paul Smolensky](http://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/paul-smolensky/). Before coming to JHU, I received a B.A. in Linguistics at Yale University, advised by [Robert Frank](https://ling.yale.edu/people/robert-frank).

I study computational linguistics using approaches from machine learning, natural language processing, and cognitive science. My main areas of focus are inductive biases (e.g., [Revisiting the poverty of the stimulus: hierarchical generalization without a hierarchical bias in recurrent neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09091.pdf) by me, Robert Frank, and Tal Linzen), representations of structure (e.g., [RNNs implicitly implement Tensor Product Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08718.pdf) by me, Tal Linzen, Ewan Dunbar, and Paul Smolensky, and its associated [demo](https://tommccoy1.github.io/tpdn/tpr_demo.html)), and robust generalization (e.g., [Right for the Wrong Reasons: Diagnosing Syntactic Heuristics in Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01007.pdf) by me, Ellie Pavlick, and Tal Linzen). For a full list of publications, see the [Publications](https://tommccoy1.github.io/pubs/) tab.
