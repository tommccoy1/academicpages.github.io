I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University, co-advised by [Tal Linzen](http://tallinzen.net/) and [Paul Smolensky](http://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/paul-smolensky/). Before coming to JHU, I received a B.A. in Linguistics at Yale University, advised by [Robert Frank](https://ling.yale.edu/people/robert-frank).

I use computational modeling to understand the formal properties of language, how these properties are instantiated in the mind, and which of these properties are innate vs. learned. I am also interested in how advances in natural language processing can be used to advance computational linguistics, and vice versa.
