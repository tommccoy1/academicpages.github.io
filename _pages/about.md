I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University, co-advised by [Tal Linzen](http://tallinzen.net/) and [Paul Smolensky](http://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/paul-smolensky/). Before coming to JHU, I received a B.A. in Linguistics at Yale University, advised by [Robert Frank](https://ling.yale.edu/people/robert-frank).

I study computational linguistics using techniques from machine learning, natural language processing, and cognitive science. My research focuses on how to achieve **robust generalization** in models of language, as this remains one of the main areas where current AI systems fall short. In particular, I study which **inductive biases** and which **representations of structure** enable robust generalization, since these are two of the major components that determine how models generalize to novel types of input.

Representative publications:
